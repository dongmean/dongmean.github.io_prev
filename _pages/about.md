# Research Interest

My **research interest** is **solving a lack of label problem** in training DNN for various types of data. I've been proposed a (i) **metric learning** algorithm for time-series data and a (ii) **representation learning** algorithm for power-law distributed graph-structured data (both were *published* ). Recently, I've been focusing on (iii) **robust active learning** for general data with more practical settings, such as out-of-distribution (OOD) samples or noisy labeler.

**Keywords** : Representation Learning, Active Learning, Noisy Label, Out-of-distribution
